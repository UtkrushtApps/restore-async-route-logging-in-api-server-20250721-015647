# Task Overview
You are working on a FastAPI microservice that exposes a feedback submission endpoint intended for JSON POST requests. Currently, valid requests are being rejected with validation errors, especially concerning the email field and overall input validation. Your task is to diagnose and correct the input validation, ensuring that JSON payloads are accepted as intended.

# Guidance
- Focus on the input validation and request handling in the feedback submission endpoint.
- The problem is specific to how the Pydantic model and endpoint accept and validate JSON payloads, particularly email.
- The application must remain compatible with Docker deployment and should not introduce new third-party dependencies.
- Make sure that validation logic enforces required fields, correct types, and returns clear errors for invalid input.

# Objectives
- Ensure that valid feedback POST requests are accepted and processed by the API.
- Guarantee that the email field is properly validated as a required string in email format.
- Maintain informative errors for malformed requests and preserve Docker-based deployment compatibility.

# How to Verify
- Run the application in Docker and send POST requests to the /feedback endpoint with a valid JSON payload.
- Verify that valid input returns a success response (HTTP 200).
- Confirm that invalid input (e.g., missing fields or incorrect email format) returns informative validation errors with an appropriate HTTP status code.
